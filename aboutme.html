			<td><strong>Hello everyone!</strong> My name is Breanna Arnett and I am a 5th grade Math and Science teacher at Salyersville Grade School is salyersville, KY. I graduated Morehead State University in 2014 with a Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education and I am currently taking class at Eastern Kentucky University in hopes to obtain my Master's Degree in Library Science. I am hoping one day to become my schools' librarian as our current schools' librarian only has a couple years unitl she is able to retire.  		
				<p>
					My love for reading didn't begin at a young age. Actually, <i>I didn't like reading at all and struggled with it during my elementary years in school</i>. I was never the best reader and was very slow in the process of reading and understanding what I was reading. But with the help of my teachers and the dedication of my mother, I grew as a reader but still didn't take up reading for pleasure until I was a junior in high school. One of my good friends introduced me to the author <b><em>Nicholas Sparks</b></em> and I fell in love with reading from there.
				</p>
				<p>
					But the story doesn't end here.<br>
					When starting out my journey with reading, I only looked for authors and stories that centered around romance and love stories. But with suggestions from fellow readers, I was able to broaden my perspectives and find new material that drew my interest and peeked my curiosity. I began reading stories that deal in fantasy, dystopian worlds, magical realms, biographies, poems, and everything in between. Over time, my personal library has grew to over a hundred different titles and genres.
			
				<p>
					Through this website, I hope I am able to introduce new titles and authors to others who might be looking for a good book or a change in genres. I hope to share my love with others and maybe get a few suggestions for new titles or books that I haven't discovered yet! <br>
					<br><b><i>Books are a gateway into new world and adventure is just a page away!</b></i>
